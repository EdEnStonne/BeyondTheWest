[h1] Discover 3 new Slugcats from a far land [/h1]

[h2]Description :[/h2]
This mods adds 3 brand new slugcats, MSC style, with each their abilities and movement tech to discover and play around !
The mod should be fully compatible wiht Meadow arena, and partially compatible with Meadow Story mode.


[h2]Commonly asked questions :[/h2]
[h3][i]I can't unlock the campaigns[/i][/h3]
They do not have a campaign for now. Literally, the campaign is locked, and even then it's a Red campaign placeholder. This does not stop you from playing with those 3 slugs in Jolly-Coop, Arena or even Meadow !
You may need a mod like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3600123274]JollyCoop Player1 unlock[/url] to test them in Jolly Coop.
I may make some in the future, but for now my main focus is balancing and debugging the slugcats.

[h3][i]Will the slugcats be subject to change ?[/i][/h3]
Most of the main features of all three slugcats will remains untouched. However, if I find a ground-breaking bug, or feel like some slugcats need more balancing, they may have their abilities tweaked alittle. Mostly the Core and the Spark will be affected by balancing patches since they have some complex interaction with their abilities.

[h3][i]Can I make a suggestion ?[/i][/h3]
I'm all ears ! I'm all for tips and suggestion, but I won't take them blindly either. I already have ideas in mind on the storyline and on what to add if I continue to update this project further.
I will not more slugcats here though. 3 is enough for this mod.

[h2]My plans :[/h2]
For now, the top priority is fixing all bugs, balance issues and problem the mod has.
If I decide to develop it more, I'll go and add new arenas and items, before finally heading toward the actual campaign of those 3.
Let's see how far I go with this one.
