**A Rain World mod adding 3 slugcats from a far region !**


## Description : 
This mods adds 3 brand new slugcats, MSC style, with each their abilities and movement tech to discover and play around !
The mod should be fully compatible wiht Meadow arena, and partially compatible with Meadow Story mode.


## The Slugcats : 
As said above, 3 slugcats awaits you : The Trailseeker, The Core and The Spark !

### The Trailseeker 
The Trailseeker has specialized itself into exploring every corner of the world. Its pounce are shorter but longer, and it has alot of new movement tech regarding walls !

### The Core 
The Core uses the full capacity of its core to its advantage. As long as you have energy, it has the best mobility of the 3 slugcats. Your jump is replaced by a leap you can charge !

### The Spark 
The Spark may be weak in nature, but has the uncommon ability to be able to gerenerate static electricity. It can be used for defense as well as for movement, but be careful to not eletrocute yourself !


## My plans : 

### Long term :
For now, the top priority is fixing all bugs, balance issues and problem the mod has.
If I decide to develop it more, I'll go and add new arenas and items, before finally heading toward the actual campaign of those 3.
Let's see how far I go with this one.

### Short term planned additions :
- **Meadow**
  - piggyback power steal
- **Trailseeker**
  - Hold spec to ignore poles
  - Better Whiplash
- **Core**
  - DUNK SLAM
  - Explosion resistance 
  - oxygen to radius
- **Spark**
  - Electric spears are batteries 
  - Coil does "electric" damage
  - NO DEN HYPERCHARGE
  - Particles update after death
  - Slide jump momentum
  - NO DAMAGE TO HELD CREATURE
